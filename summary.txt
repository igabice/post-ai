I have updated the accept-invite page to handle the login flow as you requested.

Here's a summary of the changes:
- If a user is not logged in when they visit the accept-invite page, they will now see a message and a 'Login with Google' button.
- When they click the button and log in, the application will automatically proceed with accepting the invitation.

This should provide the user experience you were looking for.
